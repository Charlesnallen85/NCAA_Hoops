# NCAA_Hoops
__Model_2.0.R:__ Control panel for everything NCAA Hoops related that I do for the [Yale Undergraduate Sports Analytics Group](http://sports.sites.yale.edu) (YUSAG). Everything is controlled with this script, including creating the model, making the [YUSAG Bracket](http://sports.sites.yale.edu/yusag-bracketology), and simulating Ivy League games. Note that large chunks of code are commented out. These code chunks correspond to the upcoming 2017-18 college basketball season, and will be uncommented as soon as the NCAA releases the official 2017-18 schedule (and the appropriate data is obtained). Be sure to follow along on 

__NCAA_Scrape.R:__ An algorithim to scrape game schedule/result data from the NCAA website. This script is mostly copied from a scrape done by Prof. Jay Emerson in STAT 230: Introductory Data Analysis (Spring 2016).

__2.0_Files/:__ A collection of files that are essentially the "inner workings" of everything done in this project.
